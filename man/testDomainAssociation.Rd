\title{PFAM domain-domain association analysis}
\usage{
testDomainAssociation(gr)
}
\arguments{
\item{gr}{An object of class \code{\linkS4class{graph}} storing the BioPlex PPIs.
Typically obtained via \code{\link{bioplex2graph}}.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} containing all tested PFAM domain pairs ordered by
association strength.
}
\description{
Identifies statistically associated protein domain pairs
connected by a disproportionally high number of protein-protein interactions.
}
\details{
Given PFAM domain annotations for each node of the graph, the function
assesses domain pairs connected by two or more interactions for significance
using Fisherâ€™s exact test based on 1) the number of interactions connecting both
domains; 2) the numbers of interactions involving either domain individually;
and 3) the number of interactions not involving either domain.

It is important to note that although the domain association analysis identifies
pairs of PFAM domains whose parent proteins interact preferentially across the
network, this does not necessarily mean that these domains themselves are
responsible for the interaction. Many may simply be passengers that associate
as a consequence of interactions mediated by contacts elsewhere in the protein
sequence.
